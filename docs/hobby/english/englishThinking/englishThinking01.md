# Identify objects around you in English
> [001] stop translating in your head！

The first way to stop translating in your head is to identify the objects around you in your target language.

So if you're studying English that means you look at the objects around the room look at the things in your life.

Don't think of them in your native language first think of them in your target language first.

So if i look around of the room, I see a computer, I shouldn't think my native language word, I should think my target language word.

So start with the items and the situations in your everyday life.

If i say 'computer' in English, maybe i should 'computar' in Japanese, I should say not, I don't know, 'water' in English I should say 'oumizi' in Japanese, so start associating the words in your target language with your everyday life now.

So if you're studying English, that means start getting familiar with things in your everyday life in English.
