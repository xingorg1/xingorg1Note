# Don't bring a dictionary to your lesson.

> [005] stop translating in your head！(2020-06-06)

Tip number five is don't bring a dictionary to your lesson. Okay, so give me a second here. So I understand the dictionaries, it was, especially electronic dictionaries, We have them on our phones now, are very convenient. Of course, it's important to use them and they're a great resource to have.

However, one thing that really bothers me and that, I think is detrimental, it's not helpful for students, is when students are in a lesson and they're practicing conversation, and they reach a point in the conversation where they don't know the word, they want to use. They know it in their native language and they don't know how to say it in their target language. They pull out their dictionary, they say to this the person, listening to them, their practice partner in their lesson where they have a limited period of time, just a moment, and then they look it up on their phone, it takes a few seconds the flow of the conversation stops, and then they say a word.

It's like, WOW! NO! that's not, you don't have that ability, you don't have the ability to do that in a conversation with a native speaker.

Most people like if you go to a bank and try to open a back accounnt, are you really gonna pull out your dictionary and sit there, and try to communicate? you know, "just a moment", "just a moment", as you look up each word you don't know? No, or if you do, that's not a real conversation.

So, instead try using a different straregy, by that I mean, if you find a word you don't know in conversation, explain the word to your conversation partner, maybe they know the word.If you're speaking with a native speaker, this is a chance for them to teach you a word.

I find that when people take the time to teach me a word, I remember the word much better than just looking it up on my dictionary.

So try to resist, maybe you can bring a dictionary to your lesson, but don't use it or try not to use it in your conversation practice. It's just, it destroys the flow of a conversation.

So instead, practice the skill of describing the vocabulary word you want to use. and learn how to ask the meaning of a word or learn how to ask for a vocabulary word form your partner.So you can use an expression like, what's the word that means...Or, you know, it's this thing that does this and this and this, So this is an opportunity for you to describe characteristics of something or find a defferent way. You can use your body language, you can use whatever, you have a lot of tools, but try not to use a dictionary, in a conversation, because it's not realistic.


## 不要带字典去课堂
> [005] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

第五个方法就是不要带字典去课堂。好的，给我点时间。我理解的字典，是在我们手机上装的那种很方便的电子词典。当然，使用他们很重要，他们有很多资源。

然而，有一件事困扰我的就是，我觉得下面的场景是detrimental（不利的），对学生没用的。当学生们在课堂上进行对话练习的时候，他们发现自己想用但是不知道的单词，他们知道怎么用本土语言说，但是不知道怎么用目标语言说，他们就拿出自己的字典，在时间有限的课堂上跟倾听他们的练习伙伴说，稍等一下，然后他们拿出手机，他们流畅的对话中断一会儿后，他们说出那个单词。

就像这样。哦！不！不要这样，你没有这个能力，你没有和本土语言者交流的能力。

这就好像很多人去银行开户，你真的能坐到那里拿出你的字典进行交流。每当你遇到不知道的单词都要说“等一会”“等一会”？不要这样，如果你真的这么做，这将不是一个真正的对话交流。

转而使用一个不同的straregy（战略、方法），顺便说下我的意思，如果你在对话中发现你不会的单词，就像你的对话伙伴解释这个单词，或许他们知道这个单词。如果你正在和一个本土语言者说话，这也是他们教你单词的好机会。我发现当人们花时间教我一个单词，我会比在字典上查到的记忆更深刻。

所以，试着去resist（抵抗、忍耐），或许你可以把字典带到课堂，但是不要使用它，或者不要在对话练习中使用它。这样会打断对话的流畅程度。

代替的，练习描述你想使用的字典单词的技巧，学习怎样去询问一个单词的意思或者学习从你的学习伙伴那里询问单词。那样，你就可以使用一个比喻描述，比如这个单词的意思是... 或者说，这是一个什么样什么样的事等。

这对于你来说将是一个描述一些事物的特征或者找到不同的方式表达的好机会。你可以使用你的肢体语言协助描述。或者你可以使用任何其他的你有的大量工具。但是切记在对话中不要使用字典，因为那样是不realistic（现实的）的。
