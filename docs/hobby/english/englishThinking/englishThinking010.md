## 使用学习者词典来查新单词
> [010] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

最后一个关键点是使用学习者的词典来查单词。

在英语中，有一些学习者用的字典。我个人比较喜欢Merriam-Webster。

MW是一个资源非常丰富的词典。他们非常有趣，他们有大量的（tons，吨？）历史故事，我最近真的是坐在那里读上边的内容。

当然，他们又一个定义，一个单词的意思。也有单词的例句，但是MW也不叫学习者词典。如果你发现一个你没有recognize的单词，你可以在学习者词典上查找他们，他会用简单的英语给你一个关于这个单词的简单的解释。

所以，使用英语来代替你的母语查单词吧，这将再一次帮助你理解你关注的单词。你会从你所学的语言中理解他们，而不是从你的母语思维去理解。

因此，使用学习者的词典会真的真的非常有用的。

好啦，这就是是个方法，10个帮助你停止在脑海里翻译的方法。

我知道这非常的困难，但是，这需要花费大量的时间和大量的练习，但是我希望这些点（stategies：策略，方案）可以帮助你去学习任何的语言。我希望这些会对你有用。
