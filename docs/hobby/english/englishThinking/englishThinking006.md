# Train responses to common questions

> [006] stop translating in your head！(2020-06-07 ~ 06-11)

Number six is a quick one, I think number six, `hint` number six, I have is just to train responses to common questions.

Train responses to common questions. So for example, a very common question in English is, "hey, how are you?". You should know how to answer this question, just have a ``default response``, "Hey, how are you?", "I'm good!".

If it takes you a lone time to answer the question "Hey, how are you?", you need to practice, I think that's a pretty good ``indicator``.

So for example, sometimes I ask students a question like that they haven't `quite gotten` the idea of how to respond, just yet they're not so quick at responding.

I say, "hey, how are you" and they say "yes", and then they think and they go, "I am, I'm good". And it's like, that's a very common question. So think about just a `default response` that you can `spit out`, that you can quickly say. If it's, "how was your weekend" or "hey what's up" or "what do you want to do for dinner tonight", think about like, just a handful meaning, just a few responses to those questions and train them quickly.

Just "how are you", "I'm good", "how are you", "I'm okay", "how are you", "not bad". These's three, so it's just training responses to those questions. There's no reason to be surprised by a question like "how are you", like, that's a very common questions. So for those common questions, train responses, so that we've got a bunch of videos, especially beginner level videos for some example responses you can do. So don't get `stuck with` these little questions, just train a few responses, practice a few responses till they fell natural to you. It'll save you time and it'll help the person asking the question to move forward in the conversation.


## 练习常用问题的回答
> [006] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

第六点很简单，我认为。提示（hint）六，就是训练常用问题的回答。

举个例子，一句在英语中很常见的问题：“嘿，你过得怎么样”，你应该知道怎么回答这个问题，有一个预定的回答：“嘿，你过得怎么样”，”我很好“！

如果这个问题花费了你很长的时间去回答，那么你就需要联系了，我认为这是一个很好的`indicator`（参考线）。

比如，有时候我问学生一个类似这样的问题，他们没有十分明确的想法来怎么回复我，（quite gotten 相当好的），就像他们没有如此快速的反应。

我说，“嘿，你过得怎么样”，他们回答“yes”，之后想了一会儿后说，“我，我很好”，就像这样，这是一个非常常见的问题，所以你应该像一个预先的能让你轻松回答的答案（spit out）。那样你就能快速的回答了。如果问题是，“周末过的怎么样？”或者“嘿，怎么了“ 又或者”你今晚想吃什么”之类的，思考这些问题后得到一个困难的意思，一些回应这些问题的答案，然后快速练习这些。

就像“你过得怎么样”，“我很好”。“你过得怎么样”，“我很好”。“你过得怎么样”，“还不错”等这三句。就这样练习回应这些问题。像这种问题就很普通没有什么惊奇的，这是一个非常普通的问题。所以对待这些普通的问题，就是练习回答。那样我们得到一个视频的bunch，尤其是那些为了一些你会的简单的示例回答的初级水平的视频，所以不要get stuck 这些小问题，就练习一些回答，直到回答他们对你来说非常的自然。这会节省你的时间，帮助问你问题的人能更好的和你交流。（forward）
