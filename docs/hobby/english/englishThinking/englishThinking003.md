Make a situation where you can't escape into your native language.

Essentially means immerse yourself.

Of course, going to that country are going to a place where you can speak only that language is very difficult for some of you, totally understand.

But if in your life, you can create a situation, in your library, in your room, in your house somewhere for just an hour, or, I don't know, maybe a day, I don't know what your schedule is like.but if you can create a situation or create an environment where you have no choice but to use that language, and you cannot escape, meaning you cannot go back to using your native language as a crutch, you can't use the native language at all.It forces you to use the language that you're studying.

So of course, if you are lucky enough to live in the country or to live in a place where people speak the language, you're studying great, but you have to go out and interact with people, you have to put yourself in a place where you have no choice but to speak.

It's very hard, and it's very scary and it's very embarrassing at first. but if you take time to find places and to make environment that are comfortable for you where you feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions, it's very valuable for your learning process.

This is actually something that i did totally, I totally did this.

My Japanese wasn't very good for a long time, but then I started making friends who could not speak English, actually I just did this through finding hobbies, there was a hobby that I had, I joined a group, I joined actually a school to where I could learn how to do that hobby, and everything was taught only in Japanese and the people in my class only spoke Japanese mostly.

and then maybe we would go out to for drinks and food late at night or on the weekends and everybody spoke only Janpanese.

And if i couldn't communicate even simply in Japanese, I had no hope of keeping that friendship together.So it forced me to study, it forced me to think about the words they were using, and to try to learn those words, those partterns, as well as how to produce them naturally myself.

so I was learning the vocabulary words the people around me were using, and learning how to apply them on my own. That was only possible because I had no escape in those situations.

So try to do that, even if you can do it yourself in your house, it's super helpful, I think.

## 创造一个你不能说母语的场景
> [003] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

创造一个你不能说母语的场景，或者说让你自己沉浸到那个场景。

当然，去一个你只能说其他语言的国家或地方并能完全理解对你来说是非常难得。

但是在你的生活中，你可以创造一个环境。比如在你的图书馆、房间、或者你家里的任何一个地方，用上一个小时或许一天时间，毕竟我也不知道你的时间表。但是你可以创造这样一个地方，一个环境，你只能说目标语言而别无其他选择，不能逃避，意味着你不能使用你的母语作为表达，你完全不能用你的母语的地方，这样会迫使你用你正在学习的语言。

当然，如果你足够幸运生活在人们就说这种语言的国家或者一个地方，你将会学习的更好，你应该走出去和人们interact，你应该将自己置身于一个你只能说目标语言而别无选择的地方。

一开始，这是非常困难、非常scary，并且非常令人尴尬的。但是，如果你花费时间去寻找一个你问问题和犯错都会觉得很舒服的地方，并且让使环境对你来说变得舒服，这对你的学习过程来说非常的有价值。

这也是我做过的事情。

我的日语在很长一段时间里都很不好，后来我开始交一些不说英语的朋友，事实上我通过这个来发展自己的兴趣爱好，我加入了一个有我的爱好的组，事实上我加入的是一个可以关于爱好学习的学校，我们讨论的每件事都是日语，我课堂上的同学都只说日语。

当我们出去喝酒、聚会、在周末吃晚餐的时候每个人都是说日语的。

如果我不能用日语进行简单的交流，我将不能和我的同学们保持友谊。因此这迫使我去学习，迫使我思考他们使用的单词，并且试着学习这些单词、partterns，直到我能很自然的使用他们。

所以我学习我周围人使用的单词，学习怎样更好的使用他们。这是唯一的出路因为我不能逃离这个环境。

所以试着这么做吧，甚至可以在自己的屋子里，我认为这非常有用。
