# Study with materials that don't provide a translation

> [007] stop translating in your head！(2020-06-13)

The next tip is to study with materials that don't provide a translation.

So by this I mean, if you're using worksheets or some kind of textbook of whatever. and it has your target language, the language you're studying, and it has your native language next to it.

While this can be useful I feel that if you can studying your materials, only in your target language, and then simplified explanations for more detailed points also in your target language can be a little bit bitter.

So I don't want to say like, you should only study things in your target language and nothing from your native language. Cause of course, like, it can be helpful sometimes to look up a word or to understand, a grammer point in your native language, but where possible, if you can find something that provides simplified explanations in your target languange, It can be really really helpful.

Because again you're thinking, you're learning to think on like a simpler on a more basic level about the language you're studying, in the language that you're studying. so this can be really really good.

So finding some materials to use where there's no translation, maybe you can practice.

of course with books and with written materials but also with like video materials as well, So there are a variety of different ways that you can find materials in your target language like in video and TV, so some things to think about there are the level of vocabulary words people are using in the media content you're watching, who the media content is intended for children, young adults, adults, the speed at which the speaker is talking.

so I have the ability to change the level of difficulty of video based on the rate of speech, the vocabulary words that I use and how many like idioms and things I use. So I could make a video very difficult, we could make a very like a very difficult video series by leveling up our vocabulary use or by speaking very quickly, or as you might see in like our English and three minute series, we can also use very simply vocabulary and speak at a low rate of speech.So maybe right now, this is a very intermediate level video.so please think about that.

so not just for written materials but also for your audio and visual materials, think about who your audience is the level of the materials and so on, it can be really fun, and it can be helpful to think about your target language, in your target language.

Alright, we're almost done.

## 使用没有提供翻译的工具学习
> [007] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

下一个技巧就是使用没有提供翻译的（materials）工具学习。 我的意思呢就是，如果你用工作表（`worksheets`）或者其他一些练习本之类的工具，他的上边有你正在学习的语言，而翻译语言就在旁边。

然而，我感觉接下来这样可能会很有用。如果你的学习工具上，只使用你的目标语言，并且用你的目标语言为更多详细的知识点作出简单的解释，这样可以更合适一点。

我并不是说，你应当只用你的目标语言学习，而一点也不从本土语言学习。因为，很显然的是有时候去查找一个单词或者去理解一个你目标语言里的语言点使用本土语言会很有用。但是关键点呢是，如果你可以用目标语言做简单解释的工具去查找一些知识点，那将会非常非常(`helpful`)有用的。

因为那样你会在思考，你在学习在你所学的这门语言中，怎么像一个简单的、最基础水平的人那样思考。这将会非常有用的。

所以，去找一些没有翻译的工具使用吧，那样你可以练习。

当然，你可以用书本等（written materials）文字类工具，你也可以使用如视频等工具。那样你可以找到很多种关于你所学语言的不同困难程度的材料在视频或电视中。去思考在你所看的媒体内容中人们使用的不同水平的词汇，那些媒体内容可能是针对儿童、青年、成人等的，以及媒体内容中人们说话的速度。

我拥有改变自己视频难易程度的能力，包括调整演讲速度的、我使用的词汇单词、以及所用的多少（`idioms`）俗语等。我可以让一个视频非常困难，我们可以通过提升我们的词汇等级、加快说话速度来创造一个很困难的视频，你可以看我们的英语三分钟系列。我们也可以使用非常简单的词汇、并且说的很慢，就像现在这种水平，这是一个非常（`intermediate`）入门级的视频。

所以你可以考虑一下这些。不一定是文本类的材料，也可以是音频、视频类的材料，考虑你材料观众的水平，这很有意思。也可以对你思考你的目标语言很有帮助。

好了，就到这里了。

`The next tip is to study with materials that don't provide a translation.`
下一个技巧就是学习不提供翻译的资料。

`So by this I mean, if you're using worksheets or some kind of textbook of whatever.`

我的意思是如果你用的学习单（`worksheets: 学习单`）或者课本之类的。

`and it has your target language, the language you're studying, and it has your native language next to it.`

上面有你的目标语言——你正在学习的语言，旁边还有你的母语。

`While this can be useful I feel that if you can studying your materials, only in your target language,`

虽然这很有用，但我觉得如果你能只学习你的目标语言，

`and then simplified explanations for more detailed points also in your target language can be a little bit bitter.`

然后用你的目标语言进行更详细地简化解释会更好，

`So I don't want to say like, you should only study things in your target language and nothing from your native language.`

所以我不应该说，你应该只学习你的目标语言，不要看你的母语。

`Cause of course, like, it can be helpful sometimes to look up a word or to understand, a grammer point in your native language,`

当然，有时候查一个单词或者理解母语中的语法点是很有帮助的。

`but where possible, if you can find something that provides simplified explanations in your target languange,`

但如果可能的话，如果你能通过你的目标语言来进行简化的解释，

`It can be really really helpful.`

这真的很有帮助。

`Because again you're thinking,`

因为同样的，你在思考。


`you're learning to think on like a simpler on a more basic level about the language you're studying, in the language that you're studying.`

在你学习的语言的基础上，你在学习一种更简单的思考方式。

`so this can be really really good.`

所以这样做真的非常非常好。


`So finding some materials to use where there's no translation, maybe you can practice.`

所以找一些没有翻译，你再练习的材料。

`of course with books and with written materials but also with like video materials as well,`

当然可以用书本和书面材料，也可以用视频材料。

`So there are a variety of different ways that you can find materials in your target language like in video and TV,`

所以有很多不同的方法可以找到目标语言的材料，比如视频和电视节目。

`so some things to think about there are the level of vocabulary words people are using in the media content you're watching,`

人们需要考虑的是在你看的媒体内容中使用的词汇水平，

`who the media content is intended for children, young adults, adults,`

是为了儿童、青少年还是成年人准备的。

`the speed at which the speaker is talking.so I have the ability to change the level of difficulty of video based on the rate of speech,`

还要考虑说话者的说话速度，所以视频的难度可以基于说话的速度，

`the vocabulary words that I use and how many like idioms and things I use.`

考虑我使用的词汇量，有多少习语和我使用的一些内容。

`So I could make a video very difficult,`

所以我可以做一个很难的视频，

`we could make a very like a very difficult video series by leveling up our vocabulary use or by speaking very quickly,`

我们可以做一系列难度很大的视频，通过增加词汇量或者加快说话的速度。

`or as you might see in like our English and three minute series,`

或者你可以在我们三分钟系列英语节目中看到。

`we can also use very simply vocabulary and speak at a low rate of speech.`

我们也可以使用非常简单的词汇，用很低的语速说话。

`So maybe right now, this is a very intermediate level video.so please think about that.`

也许现在这个是一个非常中级水平的视频，所以请考虑这些。

`so not just for written materials but also for your audio and visual materials,`

所以不仅仅是书面材料(`written materials`)，还有视听材料(`visual materials`)。

`think about who your audience is the level of the materials and so on,`

想想你的听众用什么样的水平的材料等等，

`it can be really fun,`

这真的很有趣。

`and it can be helpful to think about your target language, in your target language.`

因此用你的目标语言来思考，是很有帮助的。

`Alright, we're almost done.`

好的，就这样结束了。
