Tip number four is to watch TV and movies in your target language without subtitles, without subtitles.

So I think that watching with subtitles can be very beneficial. So if I'm watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitles on, great. But I sometimes find that I can, in my case, I think too much about reading the subtitles, and I forgot to listen.

So maybe if you've seen a movie in your target language a few times with the subtitles on, try turning the subtitles off and think about the like character's body language, the words they're using. You can always look that up later, look up the, you know, the words you don't know in a dictionary.

but try to do it where you're focusing completely on the way that people are using words, try not to use the subtitles.

So, kind of play around with it a little bit, if there's a word that's difficult for you to hear, you can actually turn on the subtitles in like the, in the native language of the movie as well.

That's something that I'vd done like if, like if I wanted to study Japanese, it's very useful when the actual words spoken in Japanese appear on the screen. Sometimes it's easier for me to catch a word, if I see it visually and I hear it at the same time, So another way to kind of explore how you can use TV and movies is to actually turn on the closed captions, like the, the words on the screen in the native language of the movie.

So, so this is sort of two points in one, So one, watch movies without subtitles, meaning subtitles in your native language, and hint to is to watch movies with closed captioning on but the closed captioning is in your target language, not in your native language.

So you can try those two things with TV and with movies.

## 看目标语言的电视和电影时不要看字幕
> [004] 培养英语思维，不要在脑海中翻译中文了。

第四个技巧就是看关于目标语言的电视和电影的时候不要看字幕。不要看字幕。

我也觉得观看的时候有字幕会很便利，所以如果我看一些东西或者你想看一些带字幕的东西时也很好，但是我有时候发现，对我自己而言，我会更关注去阅读字幕而忘了倾听。

所以如果你看一个关于目标语言的电影会需要花费看字幕的时间，或许可以试着关掉字幕然后思考角色的肢体语言，思考他们使用的单词。你也可以之后去查字典找寻这些你不知道的单词。

但试着去完全关注角色使用单词的方式，而不要使用字幕。

如果有一个单词对你来说很难听懂的话，你也可以完全打开电影的关于目标语言的字幕。

这也是我会做的。就像我学习日语一样。当实际的单词被用日语表达并出现在屏幕上。有时候这将非常容易让我去抓住一个单词，如果我visually看到他并且同时听到他，
