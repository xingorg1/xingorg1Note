Tip number four is to watch TV and movies in your target language without subtitles, without subtitles.

So I think that watching with subtitles can be very beneficial. So if I'm watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitles on, great. But I sometimes find that I can, in my case, I think too much about reading the subtitles, and I forgot to listen. So maybe if you've seen a movie in your target language a few times with the subtitles on, try turning the subtitles off and think about the like character's body language, the words they're using.

You can always look that up later, look up the, you know, the words you don't know in a dictionary. but try to do it where you're focusing completely on the way that people are using words, try not to use the subtitles.
