# Do your daily activities in English where possible

> [009] stop translating in your head！(2020-06-13)

The next step is to do your daily activities in your target language.

So if you're studying English that means try to do some daily activities in English if possible.

So this can be very very boring stuff, but jsut think about it when you're doing the activity, so like right now  I'm filming a video for English class 101.com, or I'm going to work, I'm cooking breakfast, I'm doing the laundry, What do I have to do tomorrow, So try thinking about your everyday life in Engish.

If you're studying English, try thinking about your everyday activities, the people that you meet, what are you doing, So this is a way to help you pratice your verbs.

So if you don't know, if you're, I don't know you're doing something at work and you're like, oh my gosh, how to I explain the, what's the verb for, you know a picture, like I want to... a picture, what's the word, you can check a dictionary at that point and go up, it's "draw". I neet to use the verb "draw", for "draw a picture".

so you can find these little gaps in your everyday life, these little gaps in your knowledge, if you don't think about it in your target language, you might not relize you have vocabulary gaps or phrase gaps here and there.

So this is a really good and kind of funny, actually way to study.
